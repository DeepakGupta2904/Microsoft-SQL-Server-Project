# Microsoft-SQL-Server-Project
Project: Querying a Large Relational Database.
I am done this project at Intellipaat Solution Pvt. Ltd. as an Trainee.

In this project, I worked on downloading a database and restoring it on the server. Subsequently, I queried the database to retrieve customer details such as name, phone number, email ID, sales made in a specific month, month-on-month sales increase, and the total amount made for a particular customer.

Download the AdventureWorks database from the following location and restore it in your server:
Location:
https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks
File Name: AdventureWorks2012.bak

AdventureWorks is a sample database shipped with SQL Server and it can be downloaded from the GitHub site. AdventureWorks has replaced Northwind and Pubs sample databases that were available in SQL Server in 2005. Microsoft keeps updating the sample database as it releases new versions.
